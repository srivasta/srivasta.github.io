excerpt: Initial setup of the github page to mimic the look and feel of my regular website and blog

This was my first experience using Jekyll. All in all, to does not
feel very different from Ikiwiki, which is the system I have been
using. At this point, most of the projects do not have their own per
project github page, but that will change in the next few weeks.
